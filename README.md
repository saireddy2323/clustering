# CLUSTERING

# PROJECT TITLE

Analysis and prediction of "mall_customers".csv of American Market called as Phoneix Mall to findout on the basis of Clients Requirement of Dendrograms using scipy graphics Library with the help of "scipy.cluster.hierachy",to ace the no.of linkage of clustering to predict

# PROBLEM STATEMENT

The American Finance market Clients as per the rate of GDP of 2011 found as highest number of growth in their business market.

As a Datascience Engineer find out which hierarchy cluster gives maximum linkage in upcoming future.

# TASK

1) With help of Scipy Library import libraries and datasets

2) Using the Dendogram to find th optimal number of cluster
   
3) Create a Hierarchy model and visualize the cluster with help of matplot library

# CONCLUSION

According to the model building as a engineer my prediction is cluster number 3 as highest number of linkage.

# INSIGHTS 

*Cluster 1 contains ("red")which shows that unsupervisied learning cluster has maximum uequalied from the centroid upto annual income approximate "139ks"

*Cluster 2 contains ("blue") which shows that unsupervisied learning cluster has maximum uequalied system up to annual income approximate "79 to 80ks"

*Cluster 3 contains ("green") which shows that unsupervisied learning cluster has maximum uequalied system up to annual income approximate "140ks"

*Cluster 4 contains ("sky blue") which shows that unsupervisied learning cluster has maximum uequalied system up to annual income approximate "up to 40ks"

*Cluster 5 contains ("pink") which shows that unsupervisied learning cluster has maximum uequalied system up to annual income approximate " 40ks
